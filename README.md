# Q-Learning
Based on UNSW COMP9444 deep learning and neural networks assignment 3.

To run the code:
Run: neural_Qtrain.py.

Task 1:
The first task is to complete the skeleton implementation for learning on the cart-pole task
(https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0).

Task 2:
The aim of the second task is to generalize your algorithm so it will also work on other
environments, including mountain-car and inverted-pendulum. Each with the respective links below:
